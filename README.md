# Diablo II - LoD "Hit Chance Cap Fix"
Increase (or decrease) player characters' max hit chance.

## Details
This repository contains enough info to be able to manually patch your game with a fix.

## Explanation
The unmodified game caps player characters' hit chance at 95 %.

I personally hate that non-magic attacks have at minimum a 5 % miss chance while magic attacks always hit.

Some people might want an even greater miss chance in their mod, to each their own.

My preferred way to fix this issue is to raise the hit chance cap to 100 %.
