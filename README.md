# Diablo II - LoD "Hit Chance Cap Fix"
Increase (or decrease) player characters' max hit chance.

## Details
This repository contains enough info to be able to manually patch your game with a fix.

## Explanation
The unmodified game caps player characters' hit chance at 95 %.

I personally hate that non-magic attacks can never hit enemies in a consistent way while magic attacks always hit and cannot be blocked.

My preferred way to fix this issue is to raise the hit chance cap to 100 %.

Since almost every mob in the game has a semi hidden block chance this fix is far from gamebreaking.
